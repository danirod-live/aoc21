---------------

This year I needed a vacation and thus I am not solving the problems every day. I'm solving problems every few days.

As usual I am streaming how I solve the problems, but this year I am not broadcasting the streams through youtube.com/makigas, but through twitch.tv/danirod. VODs are available through Twitch VOD system and also reuploaded to my second YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf7Nw_MU4SewgNViz_W53O-eqNtYHfQXd.

Languages
---------

I am using Ruby.

Problem 06 was solved in Golang. It is the same algorithm but in Ruby it was very slow so I decided to use a second language and the chat proposed to use Golang.

Problem 07 was solved in Microsoft Excel and thus the folder 07 contains an XLSX file.

I would want to solve them in Haskell but I could not care less about monads, so I am sorry.
